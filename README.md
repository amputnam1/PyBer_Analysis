# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The analysis was a summary of the Dataframe of the ride0-sharing data by city type. Pandas and Matplotlib was used to create a multiple-line graph to show weekly fares for each city type. The report and results summarizes data and the differences by city type in order to be utlized by decision makers at the company PyBer.

# Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

The bubble chart shows the average fare of rides in various cities as well as the total number of rides for each respective city.

**From the analysis and data we can deduce the following:**
- It appears that the fares in urban cities are less expensive than those in rural cities.
- There are more drives in urban cities than rural cities, and suburban cities fall between them.

In the above bar-and-whisker chart we can see what the range is betwene number of rides in each city and city type. There is more rideshare in urban cities, a bit less in suburban areas, and far less in rural areas.
