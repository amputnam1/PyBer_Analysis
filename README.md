# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis**

The analysis was a summary of the Dataframe of the ride0-sharing data by city type. Pandas and Matplotlib was used to create a multiple-line graph to show weekly fares for each city type. The report and results summarizes data and the differences by city type in order to be utlized by decision makers at the company PyBer.

**Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types**

The bubble chart shows the average fare of rides in various cities as well as the total number of rides for each respective city.

**From the analysis and data we can deduce the following:**
- It appears that the fares in urban cities are less expensive than those in rural cities.
- There are more drives in urban cities than rural cities, and suburban cities fall between them.

In the above bar-and-whisker chart we can see what the range is betwene number of rides in each city and city type. There is more rideshare in urban cities, a bit less in suburban areas, and far less in rural areas.

The pie chart of % of total fares by city type indicates that the urban areas have the majority percentage of all the fares by the company, respectively at 62.7%.

The pie chart included above shows the total number of rides given by city type. It's clear through this second part chart that the urban areas have the highest percentage of the total at 68.4%, Suburban cities coming in second at 26.3%, and Rural cities having 5.3% of the total market.

The final pie charge shows the % of total drivers by city type represented as percentages. It's clear that the majority of drivers (80.9%) worked for PyBer and are driving in urban areas over Suburban (16.5%) and Rural (2.6%).

In the line chart we can see the total fare by city type. It's clear that the weekly fare intake numbers are higher in urban locations compared to their rural and suburban counterparts.

# Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

In this assignment we were able to merge and analyze the datasets thus producing pie charts, line charts, and other visual representations to compare and contrast PyBer data with respect to total fare by city type, % of total drivers by city type, % of total rides by city type, % of total fares by city type, driver count data (2019), ride fare data (2019), ride count data (2019), and PyBer ride-sharing data.

Based on this analysis, we can glean insightful information to potentially suggest the following business recommendations to the CEO in order to address disaparties among city types:

1. Increase marketing strategies or digital marketing campaigns targeted to rural or suburban markets. Take advantage of Google Ads or similar campaign marketing to target segments, location, and optimization score benefits to reach the appropriate user base within the market.
2. In tandem with the above, expand drivers in rural markets throuugh similar marketing or ad strategies. Growing the driven base in rural areas will be key to expanding business in these areas and segments. Consider other incentivization or reward strategies to recruit and retain drivers, or potentially urban drivers willing to expand their normal urban radius. 
3. Think about potentially raising the prices of fares in the urban market where PyBer has the most business.
